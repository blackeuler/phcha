        <p >The <span class="phchablue">Park Heights Community Health</span> seeks to collaborate in the improvement of the health of Baltimore's Park Heights community through health and wellness initiatives, environmentalism, community education and service.</p>

      <p>We work to reverse health disparities as they currently exist by inspiring self-determination within individuals and families, so that they may be proactive about their own wellness. We want to be a resource that moves the community toward a better understanding of health navigation, wellness as a lifestyle, environmental justice, and community development supported by the dual pillars of education and service.</P>

      <p>We envision a world where "health" is defined in comprehensive ways rather than as the simple absence of disease; where individuals and families have equal access to the knowledge, tools and resources that can improve their health; and where all members of communities like Park Heights are empowered to be proactively engaged as advocates of their own health.</p>
